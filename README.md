# PE-class-work
The teacher asked us to talk about the immune system, so I'll use turtle graphics and some nice schematics to help myself illustrating everything

I want anybody who needs this to be able to download the code and use it as easy as possible.
It's all python turtle graphics because I don't really need performance or animations, If i'll need some tho, I'll use Love2D, but as you are reading this, I didn't need it yet

This project is inspired by kurzgesagt's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQGOcOUBi6s&t=137s on the immune system

Files are all in UTF8 encoding


# how to run the project
Download all the files, then just double click on the "Controllable scheme.py" file, and then you should be able to run it.
NOTE: make sure you have python installed because this projecct is completely written in Python.
