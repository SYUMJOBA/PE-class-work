# PE-class-work
The teacher asked us to talk about the immune system, so I'll use turtle graphics and some nice schematics to help myself illustrating everything

I want anybody who needs this to be able to download the code and use it as easy as possible.
It's all python turtle graphics because I don't really need performance or animations, If i'll need some tho, I'll use Love2D, but as you are reading this, I didn't need it yet
