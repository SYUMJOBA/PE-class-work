- use turtle graphics
- find a way to draw circular sector
- a folder with a sample photo for every schematic representation for each cell
- small library that shortens the turtle graphics functions, so that it will be easier and faster to code, called "FastTurtle"
- small library that includes in a dictionary all the immune system colours associated to the functions, according to the notes.txt file present in the directory
- small library that includes one function for each cell to draw, example: I call DrawHelperTCell(PositionX, PositionY) and the turtle will draw the cell for me
- complete the "Immune system 1 notes.txt" file

- the final result needs to render an entire image as the one shown here as "complete scheme.png"
