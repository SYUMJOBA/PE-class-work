#BEGINNING INTRODUCTION

Every second of your life you are ander attack
Bilions of bacteria, viruses and fungi are trying to make you theyr home
So our body developed a super complex little army with guards, soldiers, wapon factories and intelligent soldiers that prevents us from dying
So let's see what happens during an infection

#FINISHED INTRODUCTION

for this video, let's assume that the immune system has 12 different jobs:
	__________________________________________________________________________________
	-	1. Communicate		5. Cause inflammation	9.  Strategic decisions
	-	2. Kill enemies		6. Activate other cells	10. remember enemies
	-	3. stanby mode		7. produce antibodies	11. mark/disable enemies 1
	-	4. fight worms		8. kill infected cells	12. mark/disable enemies 2

and let's assume that it has 21 different cells and protein forces adn that these cells have up to 4 different jobs

Now let's make this understandable, first by illustrating the functions with colors
	1  - Beije
	2  - red
	3  - light blue
	4  - grass green
	5  - orange
	6  - yellow
	7  - electric blue
	8  - pink
	9  - white
	10 - purple
	11 - dark water-green
	12 - bright water-gree

and maybe illustrating the cells with the corresponding colours
	The central colour represents the main function of the cell, the surrounding ones, represent secondary duties

	#make some python code snippets to represent all the different cells


so what happens in the case of an infection?
	Let's suppose that in a normal day, a wild rusty nail appears and you cut yourself
	so the first barrier of the immune syestem is breached: your skin
	Nearby bacteria seize on the opportunity and enter your wound, using your body recources and doubling theyr number every 20 minutes.

	Initially they are unnoticed and harmless, 
	but at some point when they reach large numbers, 
	they start damaging the body by changing the eveironment around them (damaging body cells ofc)
	so the immune system has to stop them as fast as possible.

	initially, macrophages intervene, they are large cells (21 micrometres) that have the only purpose of killing
	they can devour up to 100 intruders each, the swallow the enemy as a whole and then trap it inside a membrane
	after that, the enemy is broken down by enzimes and so killed.

	On top of that they cause inflammation, 
	and inflamation means breaching the blood vessel 
	so it releases water facilitating the movoment in the battlefield.
	This is noticed as a very mild swelling.

	If they need packup, they release a messenger protein that comunicates urgency and location.
	The Neutrophiles patrolling the blood vessel leave theyr patrol state and go straight to the battlefield.
	Neutrophils are cells that fight and kill so furiously that kill even other cells in the process.
	On top of that Neutrophiles generate barriers that trap and kill bacteria.
	
	They are so deadly, that they evolved to commit suicide after 5 days to prevent from making too much damage.
	
	if this is not enough, the brain of the immune system kicks in
	Macrophages comunicate with a dendritic cell, so that they start collecting sample pieces from the enemy.
	They rip them into pieces and present the parts on their outer layer (i mean on the membrane).
	
	Now the dentritic Cell makes a crucial decision, 
	should they call an army of anti-viral forces that eradicate infected cells 
	or an army of bacteria killers? 
	In this case he will call anti-bacteria forces, wich is what we're dealing with now.
	
	Multiple Dendritic Cells are called and later, in about a day they travel to the closest lymph node.
	Here, bilions of helper and killer T cells are waiting to be activated. 

	When T cells are born, they go trough a difficult and complicated training process and only a quarter survives
	The survivor cells are equipped with a specific set-up, and they are born as virgin, and they look for a dendritic cell wich has a complementary set-up,
	the one shown on the Dendritic cell's membrane wich are the parts of the intruder basically.

	When it finally finds one, a chain reaction takes place, the helper T cell is activated and it quickly duplicates thousands of times.

	- Some become MEMORY T cells and stay in the lymph node
	- Some travel to the field to help out
	- Some travel to the center of the lymph node to activate a very powerful weapons factory, B cells

	B cells work like the T cells, they work upon activation and they are born with a specific setup,
	when a B cell and a T cell with complementary setups meet and touch, a chain reaction takes place.
	The B cell dublicates incredibly fast and starts producing milions if not billions or more of weapons. 
	They work so hard that they would literally die from exhaustion very fast.
	Here helper T cells play another important role, stimulating the hard working factories and telling them to not stop.
	
	Exhausting to the last the cells instead of making new ones makes sure that they die when the infection is over,
	So that the body doesn't waste energy or hurt itself. 

	But what is produced by the B cells? You've heard of them of course, ANTIBODIES.
	Little proteins that are engineered to bind to the surface of the specific intruder.
	There are even different kind of antiboies that have slightly different jobs.
	The helper T cells tell the plasma cells wich type is needed the most in this particular invasion.
	Milions of them flood the blood and saturate the body.
	
	Meanwhile the situation at the battlefield is getting worse, the intruders have multiplied and start hurting the body.
	Guard and attack cells fight hard but also die in the process, helper T cells keeps them alive and active a bit longer but they alone are not enought to overwhelm the intruder bacteria.
	But now the second line of defense arrives, bilions of antibodies flood the battlefield and disable lots of intruders,
	Making them helpless or killing them in the process.

	They even stick to the bacteria and make them an easy target,
	their back is built to connect to killer cells, so they can connect and kill the enemy more easily. 
	Macrofages are especially good at nomming up the bacteria wich antibodies have attached to.

	Now everything shifts and the balance is restored to original.
	At this point, milions of body cells already died.
	No big deal tho because the losses are quickly replenished.
	No that the battle is over the cells commit suicide since they don't receive anymore the constant signal from helper T cells, because they are useless now.
	
	Some cells stay behind tho, Memory helper T cells and Memory B cells, so that
	if you'll ever encouner this enemy again, it will be killed even before you'll notice, 
	since they'll be ready for it. 

	This was an extremely simplified version of the immune system.
	We ingored a lot of chemestry behind what happens and other general players.
	For now we wanted to focus on the key concepts.

	Life is awfully complicated, but if we take time to undertand it, we'll encounter endless wonders and great beauty.
